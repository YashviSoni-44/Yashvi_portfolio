✨ Key Features
This portfolio is more than just a static page; it's an interactive experience designed to stand out and demonstrate key front-end development skills.

Live Particle Background: An engaging, animated background powered by Particles.js that subtly changes with the theme.

Dual-Theme Mode: A smooth light/dark mode theme switcher that remembers the user's preference using localStorage.

Custom Cursor with Trail: A unique, fluid cursor with a "bubble trail" effect that smoothly follows the mouse, built with vanilla JavaScript to enhance interactivity.

Dynamic Typing Animation: A Typed.js implementation in the hero section that cycles through key skills like AI, Machine Learning, and Full-Stack Development.

Interactive 3D Certification Cards: A grid of certification logos that perform a 3D flip on hover to reveal a detailed list of achievements from each provider.

Serverless Contact Form: A secure, integrated contact form powered by EmailJS. It sends messages directly to my inbox without needing a traditional backend server, showcasing knowledge of third-party API integration.

Responsive & Mobile-First: A clean, accessible design that ensures a seamless experience on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.

Subtle Scroll Animations: Professional fade-in animations on sections as the user scrolls, powered by the AOS (Animate on Scroll) library.
